# Benchmark | node | python VS FPC (Lazarus-Delphi) servers



[My Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC40vkVRoZ4vWl5E-wsDhKfQ)


Benchmark test for FPC (lazarus-delphi) servers with mormot and brook frameworks against node and python (flask).

### wrk - a HTTP benchmarking tool

[wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) wrk is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.


### Framework Brook

> [Brook](https://github.com/risoflora/brookframework) is a cross-platform microframework which helps to develop web Pascal applications built by Delphi or Lazarus IDE and Free Pascal. Its core has been developed using the Sagui library, that's why it is so fast, compact and useful to run on embedded systems.

### Framework MORMOT2

> [MORMOT2](https://github.com/synopse/mORMot2) mORMot is an Open Source Client-Server ORM SOA MVC framework for Delphi 6 up to the latest Delphi and FPC revisions, targeting Windows/Linux for servers, and any platform for clients (including mobile or AJAX).

### NODE server


```
const http = require('http');

const requestListener = function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('<h1>pong</h1>');
}

const server = http.createServer(requestListener);
server.listen(9001);
```

### Python server
```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "<h1>Pong</h1>"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from waitress import serve
    serve(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=9002)

# Conclusion:
We can see the test result of each http server and how mormot wins the challenge, fpc mormot is 3 times faster than node and 2 times faster than fpc Brook, http server with python is the slowest based on the result. please contact me with any suggestions to improve any of the servers and thank you.
